	<strong>You head south...</strong>
	<br><br>
	Just above, you can see a castle. It's so homely!<br>
	A sign to your left proudly declares "Artist in residence!", pointing to the fortified structure. It makes sense. There is an artist in residence living just ahead. A good open directory has at least one, and this clearly is a good space for the arts.<br>
	Hopefully the artist is not housed in the dungeon...<br>
	You realize that artists like moody spaces, but dungeons are a bit much sometimes.<br>
	A tidy ASCII path leads up to the place. It looks so inviting...
	<br><br>
	Taking a closer look, you notice that the castle gates are open. Visitors are welcome!<br>
	(that means you)
