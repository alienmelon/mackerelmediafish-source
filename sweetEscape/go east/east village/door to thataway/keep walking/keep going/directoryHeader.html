	<strong>You keep going...</strong>
	<br><br>
	The door in the distance... so far away... so small. It's almost entirely indistinguishable from the bright cold emptiness. You can barely make it out anymore.
	<br><br>
	The door was your only marker forward. Without it you will lose all sense of direction. You know that this is important. There's a piece of you that's determined to go all the way. You have to. You made it this far.
	<br><br>
	The rhythmic echoes of your footsteps are your only solace. The emptiness is glaring. If you manage to navigate it, you will have defeated your biggest foe yet.<br>
	With determination not to get lost despite losing all sense of direction, you point forward and commit yourself to that direction and that direction only.
	<br>
	Forward is the only way.
