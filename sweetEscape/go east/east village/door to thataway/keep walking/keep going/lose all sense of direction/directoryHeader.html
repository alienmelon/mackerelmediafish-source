	<strong>You lose all sense of direction...</strong>
	<br><br>
	The emptiness is glaring. It's like being trapped in pitch darkens, but even the dark would be gentler than this overblown nothingness. Your footsteps tap, tap, tap, tap... blindly guiding you in the direction you set out to go, looking for something you're not even sure exists anymore.
	<br><br>
	It would be easy to go back. Giving up seems reasonable when considering the hollowness that you're surrounded by.
	<br><br>
	No... You didn't come this far for nothing! It's not about what you will find at the end of this journey. It's about seeing this through. You can't let this hopeless nothingness defeat you!
	<br>
	You walk with even more determination.
	<br><br>
	There's more emptiness up ahead. <a href="the emptiness/">You reach for it.</a>
