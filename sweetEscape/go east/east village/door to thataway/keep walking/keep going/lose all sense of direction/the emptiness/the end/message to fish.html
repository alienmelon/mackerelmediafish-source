	<h1>Dear <em>the</em> Fish,</h1>
	<hr>
	<br>
	Your new place of residency has moved to the following address:
	<br>
	<a href="https://alienmelons-secret-page.itch.io/">THAT developer's secret itch page</a>
	<br><br>
	The following is your updated licensing information...<br>
	Your official Serial # is:
	<br>
	HOT-BIG-GIGABYTES-123
	<br><br>
	It no longer is this one (this is the <strong>inferior key</strong>, and therefore should not be used):
	<br>
	TINY-KEY-123
	<br><br>
	If, for some reason, our <a href="MISSING_TIKUs_BONES.png" target="_blank">champion villager</a> does not get this note to you on time then you will be locked for the undeterminable future.
	<br>
	Our hope is that this message reaches you so that you may live free.
	<br><br>
	As such, we have done all that we can.<br><br>
	Sincerely,
	<div>
