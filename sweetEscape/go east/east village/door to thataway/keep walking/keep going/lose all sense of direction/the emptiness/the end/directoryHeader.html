	<strong>The end of your journey...</strong>
	<br><br>
	Here it is!<br>
	Something...<br>
	The first sign of this space being occupied in what feels like forever.
	<br><br>
	Before you is a tiny pile of bones. This looks like the villager that the inhabitants of the East Village sent after <em>the</em> fish.<br>
	You're impressed. You didn't think those tiny villagers could navigate a space like this, let alone get this far. Those little beans are full of surprises!
	<br><br>
	The villager's bones are still clutching a note. An important message to deliver to the fish? Maybe even directions? You know that you'll find whatever it is that you're looking for here.
	<br><br>
	This is it!
