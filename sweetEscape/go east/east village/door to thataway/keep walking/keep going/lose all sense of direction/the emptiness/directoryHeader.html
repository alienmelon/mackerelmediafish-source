	<strong>Within the emptiness...</strong>
	<br><br>
	You're not sure anymore... how long you've been wandering here. How much time might have passed. Is there a world in either direction anymore? Is there life anymore? Is this all that's left for you? Do you even care?
	<br><br>
	The emptiness is so easy to embrace.
	<br><br>
	There's nothing here. It feels right, but...<br>
	A surge of hope overtakes you! You feel like there's something just ahead. You can feel the presence of something... of <em>anything</em>.
	<br><br>
	Yes. Just up ahead feels like the end.
