	<strong>You keep walking...</strong>
	<br><br>
	You leave the door far behind. It's now just a tiny dot in what feels like an infinite distance...
	<br><br>
	Your footsteps resound light echoes. The rhythmic taps are the only sound that breaks the hollow silence of this space.<br>
	You feel like you've been walking for hours. The emptiness is timeless here. There's a sense of both calm and hopelessness that pervades the nothingness. This is different from what you're used to... It's not the void. This space has never been consumed. There are no traces of virtual vermin here... There's just nothing.
	<br><br>
	There's another directory up ahead. You set out for this. You feel like it's important to see this through.
	<br>
	The only way is forward.
