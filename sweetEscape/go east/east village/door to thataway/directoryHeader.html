	<strong>You enter the door to thataway...</strong>
	<br><br>
	The door slams shut behind you with a pronounced echo that resonates about this undefined space.

	The directory here is empty. Everything is blank and gone. You wonder if the villagers mislead you?
	<br>
	Either way this is the way forward... Before you is another directory. You feel inclined to keep walking in that direction and see where it leads.
