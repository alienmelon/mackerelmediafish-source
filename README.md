 Sourcefiles for the [mackerelmediafish.com](http://mackerelmediafish.com/) ARG

Things here range from interesting htaccess on open directories, javascript, createjs, AIR, CSS...
Salvage what you want from this.

* THE_FISH = the ending's desktop pet (AIR)
* demos = the varying "Fish Demos" that are unlocked on the index page (games and silly animations. createjs and jquery mostly.)
* index.hype, residency.hype, village.hype are the hype pages. index.hype is the bulk of the work. Separate javascript files (index_onLoad.js, index_onLoad_Site.js...) are provided so you don't need Tumult Hype in order to read the javascript. Some interesting things are being done, like collision detection between page elements (div's).
* sweetEscape = the open directory branching adventure game.
* images = all art assets used
* audio = all audio assets used on the site
