index (the main site, opening index page where you interact with most of the ARG)
residency (the ghost that appears in sweetEscape)
village (the east village that appears in sweetEscape)

the javascript files are unnecessary. they are already in the tumult files.
i'm sharing them externally so you can copy/paste, use, salvage, or take whatever you want without having to have tumult hype.

the hype pages might be the most interesting for...
* use of physics and triggering physics
* collision detection between divs
* in-line text links that call tumult functions + setting those states
* some interesting css use
* various javascript that might be re-usable in your own projects if you are wondering how something was done
